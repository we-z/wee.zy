        <p class="subtitle">Choose what chooses you. Too often, we try to force love, relationships, or friendships from
            people who aren’t right for us, not realizing that we deserve genuine connections. The world is full of
            blessings within our reach, but we sometimes think they are too good for us. It’s essential to understand
            our worth and stop being our biggest blockers to getting what we want, even if it seems totally out of
            reach.<br><br>Loving yourself is a key part of this journey. Accepting who you are, flaws and all, is the
            foundation for opening up to the abundance life offers. This includes letting in love, even when it feels
            scary, and believing you deserve the kindness and care that come your way. Along the way, it’s crucial to
            quickly spot those who are hurting and judge themselves harshly, as they might try to hurt and judge you
            too. Choosing self-peace means staying away from that negative energy as much as possible.<br><br>By valuing
            ourselves and being mindful of the company we keep, we can build healthier, more fulfilling relationships
            that truly support our well-being. Stepping out of our comfort zones and embracing the amazing opportunities
            life presents allows us to see and feel all the good stuff out there for us. In doing so, we move closer to
            a life filled with genuine love and peace, recognizing that we are worthy of all the wonderful things the
            world has to offer.</p>
